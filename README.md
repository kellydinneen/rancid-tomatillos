### Challenges
- **One:** Understanding how to deploy to Heroku. Specifically using the heroku logs to figure out what we were missing or doing wrong. 
- **Two:** Figuring out how to access the youtube video and getting it to display properly with the design we had in mind. 
- **Three:**

### Wins
- **One:** Implementing React Router throughout the whole App.
- **Two:** Creating a backend server using Express and deploying that repository to Heroku. This made it possible to access the server without having to run the server locally. 
- **Three:** Using React-Youtube to access a specific movie's trailer and displaying it on the Movie's Details page. With this, implementing conditional rendering to toggle between the trailer and that movie's backdrop image.
