## Introduction
  

## Setup Instructions
To run the project locally:
- `git clone` this repo &&  `git clone` [this api repo](https://github.com/lbmerchant93/rancid-tomatillos-api-v2) for the api
- `cd` into the rancid-tomatillos repo
- run `npm start` to run the React App in your browser
- in a seperate terminal tab `cd` into the rancid-tomatillos-api
- run `node server.js` to run the api locally
- once both are running, the app is fully usable

OR

We have deployed the App and the api we created to Heroku. This way you don't have to clone them locally in order to use them! To visit either click the links below!

### Challenges
- **One:** Understanding how to deploy to Heroku. Specifically using the heroku logs to figure out what we were missing or doing wrong. 
- **Two:** Figuring out how to access the youtube video and getting it to display properly with the design we had in mind. 
- **Three:** DDAU (Data Down Action Up) specifically passing methods down and data back up. 

### Wins
- **One:** Implementing React Router throughout the whole App.
- **Two:** Creating a backend server using Express and deploying that repository to Heroku. This made it possible to access the server without having to run the server locally. 
- **Three:** Using React-Youtube to access a specific movie's trailer and displaying it on the Movie's Details page. With this, implementing conditional rendering to toggle between the trailer and that movie's backdrop image.
